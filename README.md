# Web Chat

I wanted something similar to this scene from [The Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbBGf2-WWGw)

## Show Case

## Stack

Elm + Pocketbase

## Hosting

My free trial of railway ran out and if I wanted to continue
hosting this pocketbase back end I had two choices

- Pay for the railway thing
- Rent a VPS

I decided that renting a VPS would be more fun because I would learn things
and I could use a VPS for other things.

I did not expect that setting up the reverse proxy for https would be so easy with
caddy.
